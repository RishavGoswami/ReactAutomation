# React Automation

<pre>
This will help you cut down the entire process of creating a react.js project, right from setting 
up a github repository to initialization, adding the files to the repository and finally opening the project in 
VS Code ( It's the best ) and running it.
</pre>

## Install:
<pre>
git clone "https://github.com/RishavGoswami/ReactAutomation.git"
cd ReactAutomation
source initialize.sh <Keep the files in the root so that it would be easier to access them from anywhere>
Make sure to change all directories to your directories so it look something like '/Users/'Your Username'/path/to/your/project'
</pre>

## Run:

<pre>
To run, simply write 'create-react "name of your project"' 
Note: Keep the project name in lower case
</pre>
